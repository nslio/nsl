*NOTE - NSL is still in an initial development phase!*

## Why this module
The [Node](http://nodejs.org) core only offers [essential functions](https://nodejs.org/api/). which is a [good](http://thenodeway.io/introduction/) thing!

*"[There's](https://www.npmjs.com) a Module for That"* for nearly every imaginable task. In fact there is [more than one](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=string+format) for [several tasks](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=date+format). Which might be difficult to choose from and might pose some other challenges.

__NSL__ is located in the middle between the [Node](http://nodejs.org) core and the [package ecosystem](https://www.npmjs.com). It offers an alternative.

But wait! Modules should be *small*, right?

That's right! :-) So the __NSL__ package will contain several *small* modules:

- All in one place
- Using new technology ([ES6](http://exploringjs.com))
- Written in [Clean Code](http://clean-code-developer.com)
- Considering common tasks
- Chosen (and maybe implemented) by the community
- Based on each other
- Well tested (each for itself and with each other)
- Well documented

For updates: [Stay hungry, stay foolish!](https://twitter.com/nsljs)

## Roadmap
- Add more information about __NSL__.
- Start first community survey.
- Communicate results.
- Implement most needed items.
- Release v1.0.
- Analyze community feedback.
- Plan next version.
